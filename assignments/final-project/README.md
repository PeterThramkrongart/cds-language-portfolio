##  Description

In this project, the goal is to create a  content-based book recommender using a  short book description, its rating, genre, and number of reviews. To do so, we used  

## Methods

__Data__

Originally, we wanted to use  a 2 GB datased containing over 2.3 milion books (https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/books?authuser=0). However, we found out quite soon that the file was a way too large to work with. For the sake of computational capacity, health of the _worker2_,and other's people projects, we settled with a smaller dataset which contains only 52 932 best-rated books (https://www.kaggle.com/meetnaren/goodreads-best-books). Although it has only 1/20 of the original number, we still deem the number of books sufficient. The data contains 

__Data pre-processing__
We filtered only the books in the paperback and hardback format assuming to get rid of unnecessary copies. As the data contained books from multiple languages, we used _Spacy's_ module _Fastlang_ to detect only books whose description is in the English. Also, used _Spacy_ to tokenize a lemmatize book descriptions. Lastly, we dropped books with missing values and duplicates resulting in XXXX unique titles.
The cleaning code can be found in the _prepare_data.sh_ script in the src folder.


__Recommender__

normalize - number of reviews, rating score
tfidf book description

Count vectorize - genres, author

cosine similarity - tfidf description, genres, author

We used sklearn tfidf vectorizer to create a matrix out of the book descriptions. Tfidf is generally used to express how important a words in a document is based on how many times it occurs within that document and how many times within all the documents. This leaves us with a good measure of how relevant each word in the book's description is. 

For the genre and author we used sklearn's count vectorizer to

## Reproducibility

**Step 1: Clone repository:**  

- Open a Linux terminal

- Navigate the destination of the repository

- Run the following command  

```console
 git clone https://github.com/PeterThramkrongart/cds-language-portfolio.git
``` 

**step 2: Set up the environment and activate it:**  

- Navigate to the folder "final-project" 

```console
cd assignments/final-project
```  
- We have written a bash script _create_book_recommender_venv.sh_ to set up a virtual environment: 

```console
bash create_book_recommender_venv.sh

source book_recommender_venv/bin/activate
```  

**step 3: Prepare data:**  

- Navigate to the folder "src":  

```console
cd src
```  

- Run the python script _prepare_data.py_ to clean the dataset and create necessary matrices:

 ```console
python prepare_data.py
```

**step 4: Run the recommender:**  

- Run the python script _recommender.py_ with the optional arguments:

```console
        flags: -t,   --title,               default = 1984, type = str, 
                help = str, Title to base recommendations on

        flags: -tw,  --tfidf_weight,        default = 1,    type = float, 
                help = float, The weight of tfidf on recommendations

        flags: -aw,  --authors_weight,      default = 0.2,  type = float, 
                help = float, The weight of authors on recommendations

        flags: -gw,  --genre_weight,        default = 0.8,  type = float, 
                help = "loat, The weight of genre on recommendations
        
        flags: -rcw, --review_count_weight, default = 0.2,  type = float, 
                help = float, The weight of review counts on recommendations

        flags: -rw,  --rating_weight,       default = 0.3,  type = float, 
                help = float, The weight of ratings on recommendations
```  

- Make sure that the book's title matches perfectly with the book's title on Goodreads


```console
python recommender -t "The Hunger Games" -tw 1.0 -aw -5.0 -gw 0.3 -rcw 0.0 -rw 2.0

```  
- Note: The dataset was collected in 2017 so books published after cannot be used

**step 5 (optional): Kill the environment:**  

- Navigate to the folder "final-project"

```console
cd ..
```  

- Run the bash script _kill_book_recommender_venv.sh_ to remove the virtual environment:  

```console
bash kill_network_analysis_venv.sh
```  

## Running the project on something else than Linux

Our projects are mainly made for Linux/Mac users. Our python scripts should run on any machine, though our bash scripts may not work. For this case, we recommend using the python distribution system from https://www.anaconda.com/ to set up environments using our requirements.txt files.

Project Organization
------------
The folder structure of our projects is based on a simplified version of the cookiecutter data science folder structure https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/. For the sake of generalizability, some folders will remain empty for some projects, but overall this will make folder navigation easier.
